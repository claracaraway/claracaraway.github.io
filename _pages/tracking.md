[Recursion for Beginners: A Beginner's Guide to Recursion](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfBqVVKg4GE)

1. Understanding recursion requires the understanding of THE CALL STACK (which is hard because it's invisible in python)
2. Recursion requires two things: a base case and a RETURN of a recursive statement (the one where it calls itself)
