## From a 2009 Journal

(during my time in Madrid, Spain)

The other day I wondered if I should maybe consider being a lawyer because I so enjoy proofs. I love logical answers and deciphering them from logical statements. I love how neat and organized a proof is. I often find myself daydreaming in pascals wagers (In fact, I made one for parenting to try to predict the parenting that would yield the best results for both parent and child)

The point is, like I like color coordination in my closet, I like color coordinating my thoughts. I stack them on top of one another until they make the most logical sense. It is in this way that I proved to my parents that we should get a dog. It is in this way I can prove to you that eating meat in excess is unethical. It is in this way that I do not make logical sense to myself.

On days like today, everything is a chore. All songs are sad songs and I am alone. So very alone in the biggest group. I st alone. Alone. Alone. Alone Alone. Sinking, falling, down my own hole that I dig for myself against my own will. Here I have decorated the walls with my broken parts I have unearthed along the way... cleaning them off with my tears.

In these moments, my mantras all leave me and I'm left with plains filled with nothing. Open holes in my head. They have all decided to wait out the storm elsewhere the fair-weather friends of my psyche.
