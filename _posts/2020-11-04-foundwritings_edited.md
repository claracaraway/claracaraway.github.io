## From a 2009 Journal (quick edits)

(during my time in Madrid, Spain)

The other day I wondered if I should maybe consider being a lawyer because I so enjoy proofs. I love logical answers and deciphering them from logical statements. I love how neat and organized a proof is. I often find myself daydreaming in pascals wagers (In fact, I made one for parenting to try to predict the parenting that would yield the best results for both parent and child)

The point is, like I like color coordination in my closet, I like color coordinating my thoughts. I stack them on top of one another until they make the most logical sense. It is in this way that I proved to my parents that we should get a dog. It is in this way I can prove to you that eating meat in excess is unethical. It is in this way that I do not make logical sense to myself.

Here is my proof: I am healthy I live an unbelievably charmed life I have friends, family an amazing boyfriend and best friends that will change the world.

Yet, I am sad.

-- This does NOT logically follow. This is NOT who I am. So why am I here?! Why do I feel like my brain is poisoning me!?

I am having one of those "Be happy! Your life is amazing" (internal me: "Oh! Oh! Be happy! Is that all!? Oh thank you. All better." days...

I want to hear it but someone has turned off my ears.

Sam says I should stop writing about despair and try to live the despair-free life I advertise, but, quite honestly, I haven't figured it out yet. So, until then, I will keep writing about this. I have something to say and I have many questions that I fear I left my [unfinished]

Today, everything is a chore. 
All songs are sad songs 
and I am alone. So very alone 
in the biggest group. I sit alone.
Alone. Alone. Alone Alone. Sinking, 
falling, down the hole that I dig for myself 
against my own will. Here I decorate the walls with the broken parts of myself I unearth along the way.
I've been in this hole before. 
The pieces are shined by my tears. 


In these moments, my mantras all leave me. 
I'm left with plans filled with nothing -- open holes in my head.
In these moments, my defences are gone. 

I'm left with plans 
filled with nothing. 

Open holes in my head. 
They have all decided to wait out the storm elsewhere the fair-weather friends of my psyche.
