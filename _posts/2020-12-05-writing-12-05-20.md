### CHAT WITH UNI-T:
HIM: Also: The Crown S4E7!! Wow.

ME: Also: The Crown S4E7!! Wow.

HIM: S4E7: At the start, I was wondering why they picked Helena Bonham-Carter. Now I know. She was fabulous. It’s fascinating to see the interactions of this regular family, thrown into a very very irregular situation, and how much revolves around the obligation to maintain trust in the legitimacy of royalty.

ME: Also so impressed with HBC. I also loved her in the episodes where her marriage was breaking down. She is eerily excellent at embodying impossible emotions (HAAAY OH ALLITERATION PARTAY). On a TPP note, I loved the conversation about her begging for work. I bookmarked this as TPP fodder when we discuss things like “reasons for being.” On a historical note, it was very interesting to hear the queen mum explain why they did what they did -- it made complete logical sense, and was absolutely gut wrenching and inhumane. I will have to remember this for when I become dictator and attempt to rebrand eugenics. On a personal level, I related to both the disappointment and relief of “Oh, so there isn’t something wrong with me... at least not on THAT level... yet I feel this way... so something is clearly ‘off’” -- when I was younger, I wanted so badly to be diabetic because they I would have something to “point to” like “see?! This is why I can’t control my emotions like all you normies!”
