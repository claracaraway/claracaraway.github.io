IMPETUS: I want to optimize my food shopping and reduce food waste and batch my prepping time (do two recipes call for chopped red peppers this week? Might as well do both!) and also make delicious, simple meals without spending too much time. 

PROBLEM: 
Everything is everywhere on the internet

SOLUTION:
Let's start with just two of our favorite food blogs -- Minimalist Baker and Half Baked Harvest

PROBLEM:
While it is THRILLING that both of these sites use the same wordpress plug-in so I can reuse a lot of code, not ALL of it is the same

SOLUTION: 
Use Yoast!

PROBLEM: 
The Yoast data is on the original recipe page, not the "print this" page I've been scraping from

SOLUTION:
When we get the recipe url, also scrape to get the yoast data. This can all be called "recipe data" -- the second scrape, the scrape of the print this page, this is all "ingredient data" and should live in a spreadsheet of ingredients
