## LHTL

### Juggling life and Learning

Keep perspective of what you're trying to accomplish:

* Weekly list of Key tasks
* Daily todo list, written at night
  * WHY AT NIGHT?!
  * Because, in the same way reading ahead enlists our mental zombies, todo listing at night also utilizes our zombies!


ALWAYS *PROCESS* oriented

UNLESS, it is doable within a limited period of time (then it can be PROJECT oriented)


### SUMMING UP PROCRASTINATION

* Be PROCESS instead of PROJECT oriented
* BE WARY of Procrastination Cues!!
* Commit yourself to certain routines (and certain tasks!) each day
* Keep a planner/journal and write lists at night AND during the day
* Plan quitting time just like you plan work time
