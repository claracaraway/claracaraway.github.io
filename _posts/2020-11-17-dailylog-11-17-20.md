Submitted a bug to google sheets!

HI! JUST sent feedback and I didn't correctly tell how to replicate the bug! So sorry!
1. change font for whole document
2. write in cell A1
3. CUT AND PASTE what is in cell A1 to A2
4. Return to cell A1 and type
5. Font has returned to Default Ariel?!



GOAL: I want to reduce laundry

PROBLEM: I have at least three "outfits" a day, often four

1. Work out outfit (active wear)
2. Work outfit
3. (frequently) Post Work outfit (lounge wear)
4. Sleep outfit 


MUST HAVES:
* No panty lines
* No tank tops in bed


WOULD LIKE TO HAVE:
* Feel cute and sexy

OTHER IDEAS:
* Different colors for different days of the week
* Every other week cycle
