Hi hi!
Today we are brainstorming how I can "CHUNK" my "habits" together so I can be more efficient!

There are a lot of things happening right now that are inefficient:

1. I'm using MULTIPLE DIFFERENT SYSTEMS to record my data
   1. My own Google Forms that I fill out before bed
   2. My GTD spreadsheets
   3. Reporter app
2. SO MANY REDUNDANCIES (including this note, as it is a redundancy of #1)
3. What is the ultimate goal? So I can know what I did on which day. Like journaling via a form. So I can look at my data and see progress!! Or lack of progress!! So I can reflect on how I'm using my time. So I can celebrate wins and mitigate losses. But mostly, to help me remember...

SO, here is the tentative plan:

## DAILY LOG -- STATS (from monthly GTD doc)

HIGH: Having fun with coding challenge!
LOW: LOSING ALL OF MY PROJECTS BC OF BAD NAMING CONVENTIONS
HIGH: Mandalorian
CHORES: Laundry
ENTERTAINMENT: Mandalorian
AUDIOBOOK: None
FRIENDS: Kashawn
DINNER: Leftover Burgers

## DAILY LOG -- HABITS (from mega GTD doc)

MAKE_BED: TRUE
EXERCISE: TRUE
TEXT_FRIEND: TRUE
KITTY_PETS: TRUE
5MJ: FALSE
750: FALSE
5MM: FALSE
DUO: TRUE
CAT_WALK: FALSE
